<h2>History Of the Internet 1980+</h2>
  <em>1981</em>: The National Science Foundation (NSF) provided a grant to establish the Computer Science Network (CSNET) to provide networking services to university computer scientists.<br>
  1983: The Domain Name System (DNS) establishes the familiar .edu, .gov, .com, .mil, .org, .net, and .int system for naming websites.<br>
 1986: The National Science Foundationâ€™s NSFNET goes online, the NSFNET was essentially a network of networks that connected academic users along with the ARPANET.
 1990: Tim Berners-Lee, a scientist at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, develops HyperText Markup Language (HTML).<br>
 1991: CERN introduces the World Wide Web to the public.<br>
 1994: Netscape Communications is born. Microsoft creates a Web browser for Windows 95.<br>
 
 <h2>Fundamental aspects of the internet</h2><br>
 Domain names are human-readable addresses for any web server on the internet they are necessary as it would not be easy/ possible for humans to remember ip addresses when compared to domain names.<br>
 DNS servers are there to help your computer find the ip address to the domain name that you have typed in. It accesses domain names servers and caches to find the address of the site that you are looking for.<br>
 A web server is a computer that stores web server software and a website's component files (e.g. HTML documents, images, CSS stylesheets, and JavaScript files). When a webpage needs to display the files that are stored in the web server the browser requests the file via http When the request reaches the correct web server, the HTTP server accepts request, finds the requested document , and sends it back to the browser, also through HTTP.<br><br>
 
 <h2>How has the internet changed?</h2>
 On the matter of the internet changing the way that humans can and do interact with each other from minute to minute has increased a persons ability to reach out and access other people and has given rise to near unlimited potential. From being able to chat face to face with family acroos the world to updating your friends every other minute on the latest gossip or 'memes' from across the table.
This is just one way that the internet has changed lives for the better. <br>
Small businesses or charities now have the ability to advertise themselves and give themselves the greatest chance of success in the world as it is today. <br>
Information hasnt just given the small a voice to throw out across the world but has allowed for the monitoring and reigning in of corruption in massive companies that otherwise would be able to undergo shady practices otherwise unseen.<br><br>

While the internet has given us some level of security in the form of information it has also increased the risk of the complete opposite happening and the users information could also be used against them.
The internet has many positives and negatives in the service it has provided to us however we must be sure to learn how to best use it when moving forward into the future of information technology.
